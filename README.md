# ICS Sitemap
When I worked for Oregon Tool, we had a project to bring the Oregon Construction division's website into the SAP Hybris eCommerce platform. I spun up a React Application to facilitate site architecture and content conversations with the stakeholders.
## Hosted Site
[ICS Wireframe](https://ics-wireframe.web.app/)
## Tech Used
- ReactJS
- Material UI
- Google Cloud Firebase
## Current Status
- All data manually entered
- Unweildy and impossible to maintain
- Not mobile responsive
## Roadmap
I intend to tinker with this site a bit more to move the data into a database and make it accessible through a RestAPI
